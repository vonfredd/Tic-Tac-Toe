## MVC pattern, JavaFX

A Tic-Tac-Toe application with multiplayer compability. 
You can play vs a "computer" that will make its choises based on what tiles are available by randomizing a number.

Multiplayer can only be played on a local network and
one has to host before another player can join.

This was made as a school project.
