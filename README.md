Developed with an MVC structure combined with JavaFX

A Tic-Tac-Toe application with muiltiplayer compability. 
You can play vs a "computer" that will make its choises based on what tiles are available by randomizing a number.

You can also host a game (you need to change to your localhost or ip inside the multiplayer controller, to be able to host!) or join a game. 

MULTIPLAYER CAN ONLY BE PLAYED ON LOCAL NETWORK!
One has to host before another player can join!
